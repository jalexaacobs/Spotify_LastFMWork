# Spotify_LastFMWork
Playing around with Spotify and LastFM APIs

Need to install Spotipy and Pylast python libraries

Make sure to set the necessary credentials as Environment variables (client id, client secret, redirect url)

Need to put LastFM credentials in a .credentials.json file. The program looks for LastFM_API_Key, LastFM_API_Secret, and LastFM_Password keys.

As of now its being run through Windows Task Scheduler (but might transition it online in the future)
